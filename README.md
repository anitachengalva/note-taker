# Note Taker


## Description

This application is used to write and save notes. Here I have created the back end of the code to save and retrieve data from a JSON file. This application uses Express.js and is deployed to Heroku.


## User Story

AS A small business owner  
I WANT to be able to write and save notes  
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete  


## How to Use

The user is presented with a link to the note taking page. The left-hand column contains existing notes while the right-hand column contains an empty field for a new note. Once a new note is entered, a save icon appears. Clicking the save icon places the newly created note in the left-hand column alongside the other existing notes.  
  
User may view previous notes in the left-side column by clicking on them. User may also navigate back to create a new note by clicking on the "Write" icon at the top of the page.
