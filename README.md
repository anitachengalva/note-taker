## User Story

```md
AS A small business owner  
I WANT to be able to write and save notes  
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```


## Installation and Usage

In order to run this application, you will want to `git clone` this repository so that the code is on your local machine. Run `npm i` while in the root directory in order to install all necessary [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) dependencies. Then run `npm start` to launch the server.

This application is hosted at Port 3001, so typing: `http://localhost:3001/` into the address bar of your browser (while the server is running) should display the user interface.

Alternatively, you can simply visit my [Deployed Link](https://akc-note-taker.herokuapp.com/).

Once in the application, hit the "Get Started" button to open up the Note Taker. The left-hand column contains existing notes while the right-hand column contains an empty field for a new note. Once a new note is entered, a save icon appears. Clicking the save icon places the newly created note in the left-hand column alongside the other existing notes.  
  
Users may view previous notes in the left-side column by clicking on them. Users may also navigate back to create a new note by clicking on the "Write" icon at the top of the page.
